Welcome to my GitHub repository "Shanna the Scientist." This repository contains a collection of data science tutorials and projects I have worked on. Each tutorial includes a video, transcript, and relevant files.

## About Me
Hello! I'm Shanna M., transitioning from a strong background in accounting to a career in data science. Since 2013, I've worked extensively with large datasets using Excel and NetSuite, developing strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I hold a bachelor's degree in accounting and a master's in data science.

I am actively learning essential skills such as SQL and Python. I have hands-on experience with data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. I am passionate about data science, visualization, and predictive modeling. This repository is a showcase of my work and tutorials that I have created to help others learn and improve their skills in data science. My goal is to leverage my analytical background and newly acquired data science skills to provide actionable insights and drive strategic decision-making.
